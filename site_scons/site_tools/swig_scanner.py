"""swig_scanner

Special tool which fixes standard swig scanner behavior.

Standard scons swig tool defines scanner which does not work too well
when one includes C++ headers using %include syntax. Scanner tries to
scan all includes recursively but it's no suitable for scanning pure
C++ headers as it does not recognize #include syntax.

For some details:
http://scons.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2798
https://dev.lsstcorp.org/trac/ticket/1800
https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-546

This tool replaces standard swig scanner with a special scanner which
is a combination of standard swig and C++ scanners, decision which one
to use is based on file extension.
